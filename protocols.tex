\begin{document} \begin{center} \huge Introductory tutorial to bacterial growth
and kinetic assays in the Molecular Systems Biology Group\\ \normalsize
\end{center} 

\begin{multicols}{2} This tutorial serves as a practical introduction to the
typical experimental work performed in the Molucalar Systems Biology lab. \ec\
cells will be grown from freezer stocks, and cell lysates will be prepared and
used in a simple lactate dehydrogenase kinetic assay.

\section{Sterile technique} 

When working with microorganisms almost all work is done under sterile
conditions to prevent contamination, and solutions prepared under non-sterile
conditions are subsequently sterilised by autoclaving. Contaminating bacteria,
yeast and fungi live on almost everything and float around in the laboratory
air. When using sterile technique, the following minimal guidelines apply:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Work in the laminar flow hood which provides positive
pressure (make sure the sterilising UV light is turned off whilst working the
hood, and on otherwise).  
\item Always wear latex gloves OR regularly sterilise
hands with a 70~\% ethanol solution.  
\item Flame bottlenecks with a bunsen
burner whenever they are opened or used, and flame inoculating loops before
each inoculation. Hockey-sticks should be kept in 70~\% ethanol and flamed
before use.  
\item Only use autoclaved pipette tips.  
\end{enumerate}

Note also that when using shakers and centrifuges to observe correct protocol
and ensure that flasks or centrifuge rotors are balanced.

\section{Growing \textit{Escherichia coli}} 

\ec\ is typically grown in LB medium for bulk preparation of cell matter,
however for reproducible physiological and/or kinetic studies a defined medium
such as M9 minimal medium has to be used.

To demonstrate the typical growth process of \ec\ the following steps will be
taken:

\begin{enumerate}
\item prepare either LB or M9 medium
\item inoculate a 5~ml culture from a freezer stock of \ec\ and allow it to grow overnight (O/N)
\item use the O/N culture to inoculate a large culture and incubate on a shaker at 37\dc
\item monitor cell growth using a spectrophotometer
\end{enumerate}

The following general guidelines for preparing LB or M9 medium should be
adjusted to prepare the desired amount of medium. For the purposes of this
introduction a 50~ml overnight culture and a large 500~ml culture will be
sufficient.


\subsection{Lysogeny broth (LB) medium} 

This is a rich medium composed of tryptic digests of casein (peptides), yeast
extract (vitamins, trace elements), and NaCl. As the exact composition of
constituents in tryptone and yeast extracts is unknown and will vary per batch,
LB medium is not recommended for physiological and kinetic studies, but rather
for bulk growing of bacteria (e.g. for protein expression).

To prepare 1~l of LB medium, dissolve the following components in water
(distilled water or preferably milli-Q) in a beaker with a magnetic spinner:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[h]{rc} \toprule
10~g    &tryptone \\ 
5~g     &yeast extract\\ 
10~g    &NaCl\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As a precaution it is possible at this stage to adjust the pH of the solution
but is probably unnecessary. The solution can now be decanted into Erlenmeyer
flasks, each with a cotton wool bung and foil covering the mouth (note that for
adequate aeration a 1~l culture should be grown in a 3~l flask, and
a 500~ml culture in a 2~l flask) and autoclaved (usually at 121\dc\ for 15-20
min).

\subsection{M9 minimal medium}

M9 is a minimal medium with clearly defined components making it ideal for
reproducible physiological and kinetic studies. Minimal media force the
organism to produce the majority of the required metabolites, vitamins,
and co-factors endogenously and only provides the bare minimum of components
exogenously in the medium. Unlike LB medium, M9 medium is buffered by the two
phosphate components HPO$_4^{2-}$ and H$_2$PO$_4^{1-}$. It is thus imperative
that care is taken during preparation to include the correct forms of the
phosphate salt!

To prepare 1~l of M9 medium, dissolve the following in 977~ml of water (milli-Q is
preferred for reproducibility) in a beaker with a magnetic spinner:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[h]{rc} \toprule
12.8 g  & Na$_2$HPO$_4$.7H$_2$O \textbf{OR}\\
6.0 g  & Na$_2$HPO$_4$\\\midrule
3.0 g  & KH$_2$PO$_4$\\
0.5 g   & NaCl\\
1.0 g   & NH$_4$Cl\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Also prepare a 20\% w/v glucose solution in milli-Q water (typically glucose,
sodium gluconate or glycerol are used as carbon sources); 500~ml is enough for
25~l of M9 medium.  Glucose solutions may take a while to dissolve fully, but
if left stirring with a magnetic stirrer the clumps will eventually disperse.

Transfer the M9 salts and glucose solutions to Schott bottles and prepare some
Erlenmeyer flasks for culturing by inserting a cotton wool bung into the mouth
of each flask and cover the mouth with foil (note that for adequate aeration a
1~l culture should be grown in a 3~l flask, and a 500~ml culture in a 2~l
flask). Autoclave these solutions and empty flasks (usually at 121\dc\ for
15-20 min).  The reason for autoclaving the salts and sugars separately is that
when autoclaved together the sugars are often caramelised, especially when
phosphates are present.

While the glucose and salt solutions are being autoclaved, prepare the
following two constituents. Once prepared, they should be filter sterilised
using a 50~ml syringe and a 0.2~\micro m syringe filter into 50~ml
Falcon tubes and stored at 4\dc\ (use a new filter for each solution, the
solutions can be reused for subsequent cultures as long as they do not become
contaminated):

\begin{itemize}
\item 50~ml 1~M MgSO$_4$
\item 50~ml 0.1~M CaCl$_2$
\end{itemize}

To prepare 1~l of M9 medium add the following under sterile conditions to the
977~ml M9 salts autoclaved salts in the Schott bottle:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[h]{rc} \toprule
20~ml   & 20~\% carbon source (0.2~\% final)\\
2~ml    & 1~M MgSO$_4$\\
1~ml    & 0.1~M CaCl$_2$\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As a precaution it is possible at this stage to adjust the pH of the solution
which will be buffered around 7.2 by adding sterilised NaOH/HCl. This is
generally unncecessary for growth of \ec.

This M9 medium may now be decanted into Erlenmeyer flasks for culturing.


\subsection{Batch growth -- overnight cultures} 

Bacterial stocks are typically frozen at -80\dc\ in a 50~\% glycerol solution
to protect the cells from being damaged by ice crystals. To bring the cells out
of the deep stationary phase they experience at such low temperatures we
usually start by growing a small O/N culture which is used on the following day
to inoculate a larger culture. Inoculating directly from freezer stocks is
possible, but typically involves such a long lag period as the cells ``wake
up'' that it is more convenient to start with O/N culturing. Additionally, O/N
culturing allows one to predefine the starting optical density of a culture.

Typical aerobic bacterial batch cultures are grown by
shaking in Erlenmeyer flasks. \ec\ are grown in a 37\dc\ room with sufficient
shaking to continuously ``fold'' air into the medium.

To inoculate a 50~ml O/N culture, fetch a freezer stock of \ec\ cells in an
ice-box. After allowing the sample to thaw, using sterile technique in the
laminar flow hood, inoculate the 50~ml culture with 20~\micro l of cells.
Return the freezer stock to the -80\dc\ freezer, and place the O/N culture on a
shaker in the 37\dc\ room. This culture will be ready tomorrow!

It is a good practice to leave the uninoculated large culture on a shelf in the
37~\dc\ room over night as well so that in the morning it will be at the
correct temperature for growth.


\subsection{Batch growth -- the large culture}

On the day following the growth of the O/N culture, retreive it (and the
uninoculated large culture) from the 37\dc\ room. Typically bacterial cultures
are inoculated to a final optical density at 600~nm (\od) of 0.05-0.1. To be
able to do this one has to determine the \od\ of the O/N culture and inoculate
the larger culture with enough to achieve the correct OD. Note that any steps
in which cells are either removed or added to a culture are to be performed
under sterile conditions. \od\ determinations themselves do not need to be
sterile as the contents of the cuvettes are discarded afterwards.

After a night of growth the 50~ml culture should be at an \od\ of about 1.2. As
the linear range of most spectrophotometers is 0.1-1.0, the O/N culture will
need to be diluted to measure the \od\ (a 1:2 dilution should be sufficient).
Once the \od\ has been determined, inoculate the large culture to a final \od\
of 0.1, and place it on a shaker in the 37~\dc\ room. It may be useful to
double check that the culture is in fact at an \od\ of 0.1 after inoculation.

Bacterial cultures undergo four phases of growth in a batch culture:\\
\begin{enumerate} \item Lag phase -- this is a phase in which no growth takes
place and are traditionally thought to be adjusting the new medium\footnote{It
has been shown that in fact a small persister population is growing
exponentially in the background during this phase but the growth is masked by
the presence of a large static population which results in what appears to be a
``lag'' in growth; eventually the persister population grows large enough to
take over the culture.} \item Log phase -- at this stage the cells are growing
exponentially \item Stationary phase -- exhaustion of nutrients and the
accumulation of toxic metabolic products causes the cells to stop growing in
this phase \item Death phase -- continued lack of nutrients and exposure to
toxic compounds causes the cells to gradually die off \end{enumerate}

For kinetic assays cells are typically harvested in mid-log phase to ensure
that all the cells are configured similarly and are exhibiting maximal growth
without being subject to external effects from nutrient limitation or the
accumulation of toxins.

To determine when the cells have hit mid-log phase an \od\ determination (using
1~ml of culture, retreived under sterile conditions) should be made every
30~min. Plotting \od\ on a semilog axis will result in a straight line in
log-phase. \ec\ growing aerobically usually reach mid-log phase after about
3-4~hrs and for the purposes of this introduction can be harvested at an \od\
of 0.8.

\subsection{Cell harvesting} Cells will be harvested for subsequent experiments
by centrifugation. Sterile technique is no longer necessary from this stage
onward.

Retreive the 500~ml culture from the 37\dc\ room and decant it into a Beckman
500~ml centrifuge bottle. Weigh the complete bottle including the plug and cap
on a laboratory scale, and prepare a second bottle for balancing the centrifuge
rotor by filling it with water to the same weight (centrifuges typically have a
$\pm$1~g tolerance).

Centrifuge the two bottles using a JA-10 rotor at 7000~rpm for 10~min at 4\dc.
After centrifugation a large cell pellet will have formed on the bottom of the
bottle with cells. Pour off the supernatant, add about 20~ml of buffer and
resuspend the pellet by holding the centrifuge bottle on a vortexer. After the
pellet is resuspended, transfer the cell suspension to a 50~ml falcon tube and
place it on ice. Divide the cell suspension into about 20 $\times$ 1~ml
aliquots in Eppendorf tubes.

Centrifuge the 20 Eppendorf tubes in a benchtop centrifuge at 13,500~rpm for 7
min, pour off the supernatants and store the tubes with cell pellets at -80\dc.
At this temperature cell pellets are stable for years.
